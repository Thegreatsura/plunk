/**
 * Background Job: Snooze Sweep
 *
 * Snoozing lets a recipient stop email for a fixed window instead of forever. A snooze is
 * stored as `subscribed = false` plus a `snoozedUntil` date -- not a third subscription state
 * -- so every send path suppresses a snoozed contact through the `subscribed` filter it
 * already has. Nothing in the send paths knows snoozing exists.
 *
 * The consequence is that a snooze has no way to end on its own. This sweep is the other half
 * of the feature: it resubscribes contacts whose date has passed and emits
 * `contact.subscribed` with `reason: 'snooze_expired'`, which is what makes the return visible
 * in the activity feed and able to drive a winback workflow.
 *
 * Runs every five minutes. That is far finer than it needs to be for windows measured in weeks
 * to years, and the cost of a run with nothing due is a single indexed query returning no rows.
 *
 * Re-running is safe: the sweep only ever selects contacts that are still due, so a retry after
 * a failure cannot double-wake anyone it already handled.
